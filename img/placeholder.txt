For a complete website, you would need to add the following images to the 'img' directory:

1. main-photo.jpg - A high-quality food image for the hero section background
2. restaurant-1.jpg through restaurant-6.jpg - Images for restaurant cards:
   - restaurant-1.jpg: Pizza Express
   - restaurant-2.jpg: Burger Kingdom
   - restaurant-3.jpg: Sushi Palace
   - restaurant-4.jpg: Thai Delight
   - restaurant-5.jpg: Spice Garden (Indian)
   - restaurant-6.jpg: Dosa House (South Indian)
3. dish-1.jpg through dish-8.jpg - Images for food dish cards:
   - dish-1.jpg: Margherita Pizza
   - dish-2.jpg: Chicken Burger
   - dish-3.jpg: California Roll
   - dish-4.jpg: Pad Thai
   - dish-5.jpg: Butter Chicken
   - dish-6.jpg: Paneer Tikka
   - dish-7.jpg: Masala Dosa

4. app-mockup.png - A mockup of the mobile app

Since this is a front-end only demo, you can use any food images you like, or replace these with actual images from your food delivery service.

For the hero background image (main-photo.jpg), choose a high-resolution, wide landscape image of delicious food. This image will be the main visual for your site, so it should be visually appealing and relevant to food delivery.

Common sources for placeholder images include:
- Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/s/photos/food)
- Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/search/food/)
- Lorem Picsum (https://picsum.photos/)

For a production website, you would want to optimize these images for web use to ensure fast loading times.
